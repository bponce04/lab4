# CSE 15L: Vim

## Intro:

My name is Brian Ponce and I will be going over steps 4-9 from Week 7's lab timed assesment. 

## 4) Logging into my ieng6 account

![log](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/logging%20into%20ieng6.png?raw=true)

* Keys pressed: `<enter>` after entering `ssh cs15lsp23ku@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu` so that I could enter my password and get access to my account in order to proceed with the rest of the steps

## 5) Cloning the forked repo:

![clone](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/cloning%20the%20forked%20repo.png?raw=true)

* keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, this command was 8 `<up>`'s in my terminal's history so I used it to access it and be able to clone the cloned repository, lab7.

## 6) Running the tests (check if they fail):

![JUnit 1](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/JUnit%20error.png?raw=true)

* Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, this command was 7 `<up>`'s in my terminal's history so I used it to access it to be able to show that the JUnit tests were failing before I did any changes in `vim`.

## 7) Fixing `ListExamples.java` using `vim`:

![vim](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/accessing%20vim.png?raw=true)
* Opening `vim` with `ListExamples.java` before I can do any changes
![vim2](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/editing%20the%20file.png?raw=true)
* Finding the line that needs editing and fixing it
![vim3](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/saving%20the%20edit.png?raw=true)
* Saving my changes and quitting using `:wq`
* Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, this command was 6 `<up>`'s in my terminal's history so I used it to access it to be able to call `vim` on `ListExamples.java`. 

## 8) Running the tests (check if they pass):

![JUnit 2](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/JUnit%20pass.png?raw=true)

* Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, this command was 5 `<up>`s in my terminal's history so I used it to access it and check if the JUnit tests were passing after the `vim` edit.

## 9) Saving these changes with git commands:
![commit](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/comitting%20changes.png?raw=true)
* committing the changes I made in the file
![push](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/pushing%20changes.png?raw=true)
* pushing the changes
* Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><enter>`, this command was 4 `<up>`s in my terminal's history so I used it to access it and push the changes I made to `ListExamples.java` using `vim`.

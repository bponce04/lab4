# CSE 15L: Vim

## Intro:

My name is Brian Ponce and I will be going over steps 4-9 from Week 7's lab timed assesment. 

## 4) Logging into my ieng6 account

![log](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/logging%20into%20ieng6.png?raw=true)

* Keys pressed: `<enter>` after entering `ssh cs15lsp23ku@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu` so that I could enter my password and get access to my account in order to proceed with the rest of the steps

## 5) Cloning the forked repo:

![clone](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/cloning%20forked%20repo.png?raw=true)

* keys pressed: `<enter>`, was used to be able to clone the forked repository.

## 6) Running the tests (check if they fail):

![JUnit 1](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/JUnit%20tests%20fail.png?raw=true)

* Keys pressed: `<enter>`, was used to run the JUnit tests for the first time and verify that the tests were failing.

## 7) Fixing `ListExamples.java` using `vim`:

![vim](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/vimming%20code%20(before).png?raw=true)
* Opening `vim` with `ListExamples.java` before I can do any changes
![vim2](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/vimming%20code.png?raw=true)
* Finding the line that needs editing and fixing it
* Keys pressed: `<A>`, this was to access `INSERT MODE` and edit the last instance of index1 with index2

## 8) Running the tests (check if they pass):

![JUnit 2](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/JUnit%20pass.png?raw=true)

* Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>`, this command took 2 `<up>`'s and an `<enter>`. This was to run the same command from step #6 to ensure that the file was passing all of the JUnit tests

## 9) Saving these changes with git commands:
![commit](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/adding%20and%20committing%20changes.png?raw=true)
* committing the changes I made in the file
![push](https://github.com/bponce04/lab4/blob/main/pushing%20changes.png?raw=true)
* pushing the changes
* Keys pressed: `<enter>` to add, commit, and push the changes I made to `ListExamples.java` using `vim`.
